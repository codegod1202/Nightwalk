## Challenges faced :
Tuning audio with the player's action and adding variety of sounds to make the user's experience realistic was tough for us.


## Details :
Implemented a 3D audio-based game using Unity Engine. Night Walker is built from the ground up with the needs of visually impaired players in mind, ensuring an inclusive and empowering gaming experience. The game's design is flexible, catering to different levels of visual impairment and providing a tailored experience for each player. Spatialized audio creates a rich and dynamic soundscape, allowing players to "feel" the environment and navigate through it with ease. Players navigate through immersive 3D environments, relying on their sense of hearing to locate and collect items. Utilizing the spatial audio cues, players must skillfully maneuver around obstacles and hazards to progress through the game.
